\subsection{Swarms}
\textit{Death by a thousand cuts.}

\begin{quotebox}
Quill is able to sidestep attacks from the first and second heads, but the ancient hydra's third strike sinks its teeth deep into him, lifting his flailing form above the twelve ravenous hydra heads. The snakelike swarm of snapping jaws tear into the struggling morsel, nipping chunks and limbs from the elf, snarling at competing heads. Once the bloodlust subsides, nothing of our hero remains.
