\textit{What made our heroes think they could slay a demon the size of a castle?}

\begin{quotebox}
The frost giant, limping from his severed tendon, sends his titanic hand crashing down on Dief, digging its thick fingers deep into ground. Then, with a fistful of earth and rogue, the giant wildy punches a mighty tree, sending shockwaves through the air, cracking and splintering the wood -- the final powerful blow uproots the ancient tree. Satisfied, the giant flings forth compacted clumps of dirt, rock, and Dief's lifeless body.
