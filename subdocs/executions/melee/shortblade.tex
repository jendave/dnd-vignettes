\subsection{Shortblade}
\textit{A small, quick weapon. Good for getting in close.}

  Kivan strikes the orc with a mighty off-hand uppercut, sending it tumbling backward -- as it begs for mercy, it extends a hand, a final plea
  for mercy, which Kivan severs at the elbow with his shortsword before driving his blade into the creature's heart.

  Dava plants a foot on the brute's thigh, leaping up above him, twisting, burying to the hilt her gleaming blade in his neck. She lands behind him, now unarmed, nose-to-nose with his henchmen, daring them to draw their blades as the bandit leader's enormous corpse crashes to the alley floor behind her.
