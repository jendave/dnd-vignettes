\subsection{Shortblade}

A small, quick weapon. Good for getting in close.

  Kivan strikes the orc with a mighty off-hand uppercut, sending it tumbling backward -- as it begs for mercy, it extends a hand, a final plea
  for mercy, which Kivan severs at the elbow with his shortsword before driving his blade into the creature's heart.
