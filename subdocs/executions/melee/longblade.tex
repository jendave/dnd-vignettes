The two blademasters circled each other, blades drawn, relaxed and focused. In an instant, the two collide and rebound off each other, but as Guya lowers his guard, his opponent clutches the mortal wound in his side and staggers to his knees, prostrate at the center of the dojo. As Guya turns to make his way out into the snow, the storm devours a faint whisper: "I'm sorry, brother."

The barbarian, eyes insane with rage, smashes Flametongue down, cleaving the creature's nightmarish torso in twain. Inky smoke pours forth as fire engulfs undulating postulic sacs; flame and shadow dance along the cavern walls. Eerily, the undead thing lurches onward, driven forth by dark magic, before the rotting flesh is totally consumed in torched flame.
