Vizigoth charges forth, impaling the temple guard on his pike. In a heroic feat of strength, the arena champion hoists his victim, still struggling, above him. Releasing the balanced pike, he delivers a thunderous uppercut with his spiked gauntlet, catapaulting the corpse and weapon to the gound with a crash.

Tholm is a one man phalanx, deflecting countless blows with shield and following up with a sharp thrust through a careless kobold's eye. The spear pulls sticky bone, blood and brain as Tholm snaps back into a defensive posture. The remaining creatures betray each other a worried look as the warrior tightens his grip and narrows his gaze.
