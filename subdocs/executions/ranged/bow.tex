\textit{Death at a distance.}

\begin{quotebox}
Ragefeather eyes his quarry -- two goblin lookouts, torches blazing in the moonless night, speaking loudly over the roar of the jungle. Some distance creature bellows, and both lookouts jump, turning to face an imagined threat. By the time the lookout reacts to an arrow slamming into the goblin behind him, the second arrow is on its way.
