\textit{Death at a distance.}

Ragefeather eyes his quarry -- two goblin lookouts, torches blazing in the moonless night, speaking loudly over the roar of the jungle. Some distance creature bellows, and both lookouts jump, turning to face an imagined threat. By the time the lookout reacts to an arrow slamming into the goblin behind him, the second arrow is on its way.

Blades flash as Galland counterstrikes the orc -- his blade carves a deep slice from hip to chest just as the orc's axe embeds itself in his shoulder with a sickening crack. Abe, cursing his hesistation, looses his readied arrow, sending it splintering through the orc's skull. Beatrix rushes to her fallen friend as our adventurers hear the ominous clinks and clanks of rickety crossbows being loaded on the other side of the chamber door.
