\subsection{Thrown Weapon}
\textit{Heavy boulder or balanced dagger, it's all in the wrist.}

As the assassins fan out at the entrance of the warlord's tent, Goretusk flexes and raises his heavy axe, hurling furiously toward the last to enter. The oversized weapon impacts with a bone-splintering crunch, launching the shadowing figure through the fabric wall where mud and blood mix with rain. Goretusk cracks his knuckles and charges, unarmed, at the remaining three foes.
